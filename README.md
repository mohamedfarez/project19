Iris Classification

This code performs Iris flower classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and loading the Iris dataset. It then performs some basic statistical analysis and visualizations of the dataset.

Next, the code separates the features (X) and target (Y) from the dataset, and calculates the average of each feature for all classes. It then plots a bar chart to visualize the average values.

The code then splits the dataset into training and testing sets, and trains an SVM model on the training data. It then uses the trained model to make predictions on the test data and calculates the accuracy and classification report.

Finally, the code demonstrates how to use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data, and how to save and load the trained model using pickle.
